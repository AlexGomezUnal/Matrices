Matrices (library) (C++) (Compare so i will do this library twice)

Find a better random Gen function for matrix random Generation.
N MAtrix Mult
Change from DataFrames, Excel spreadsheet, CSV, JSON, SQL to Matrix and viceversa
Matrix SUM ADN REST
N Matrix SUM AND REST
INVERSE MATRIX
DETERMINANTS
LU
QR
LQ
Rank
Complete Orthogonal 
Interpolative
SE (if i find that one paper again)
Gauss-Jordan (EQ SYSTEMS)
engine values
Transformation Matrices

Math (library)(C++)
Complex Number type
Polar, cilindrical, ?conic (coordinates)
math function input (sidef consice syntax) (summatories, productories, sequences, pow, sqrt, log_b , ln, e^x, e value, pi value, phi value, Newton series, Taylor Series, derivade, integral, partial integral, f(x), f(x,y), f(x,y,z), counter plots, surface plots, rotations,steps(desplazamientos),Cross product, dot product, even, odd, prime, number descompositions, gcd(and all that crap),floor, step, ceiling, gdp (promedy), higher derivates, multiple integration, surface integration  )
(all the other crap in Matrices adjust to Complex numbs) 


OTHER (Mostly python for AI, the fucks who knows to ACPM and C++ for PDF and the pallet)
RGB pallet (Need to know a lot about image formats, and screens ins and outs)
PDF (hex manipulation) Alhough first look in to hex manipulation if it is a thing
NPM C clone ACPM (A C Package Manager) C++ to1 C to asm to exe
AI do hex manipulation for written files then images and finally (i know i can not possible do this in my life time) videos. (also i should first learn fast ai and that stuff
AI Dungeoun Master (also android App)
Some new data Structure Mostly graphs (Maybe Integration with Neo4j, this is the vagues idea cause idk what would it actually do)
ESE (only in linux i guess but holy hell)
malware AI hex analyzer and also virtual quarentine container using the actual partion of the disk to avoid infection (i truly believe it would not work but still, Windows, Linux and Android)
